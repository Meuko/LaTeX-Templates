# LaTeX-Templates

This repository contains multiple LaTeX templates which can be used to quickly compile good looking documents ( by my preferences ). Rule of thumb; Each folder's name describes the contained document's format. The purpose of all the different folders are described below.

- **[Essay]** _Template type._
  - **Essay** _Contains the document's contents, the document's header file and a core file with references to all the documents._
  - **LaTeX** _Contains all the compiled documents, this is where you'll find the PDF._
